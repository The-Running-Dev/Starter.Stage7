### Tasks
- Framework: Convert your application from .NET framework to be .NET core. This means that some packages (such as Unity) are no longer needed as they are a part of the framework.
- Processors: Convert your processors (not the UI processor) into Azure functions. These functions should be deployed from Visual Studio, not directly in the portal
